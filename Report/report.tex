		% design assumptions and methods
		\subsection{Assumptions}
		During the design process, the following assumptions have been made \citep[p.~264]{tbook}:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item All loadings are applied at the joint,
			\item Weight of the members neglected,
			\item Joints are smooth (friction-less) pins,
			\item Each member has no more than two joints.
		\end{enumerate}
		% TODO: why trapezium
		% other designs considered
		% photo of a prototype
		Final bridge design can be seen in Figures \ref{dim} and \ref{proj}.

		% construction process 
		% materials Used
		% difficulties faced - measuring accurately, It ended up being 185mm than 187mm and the trapezium was also slightly lopsided by a 1mm, angles are fucked!
		% weight issues - excess glue fail 
		% picture of the materials used
	\section{Analysis}
		Due to the unconventional design, to ease the calculations during the analysis, it was assumed that the load is equally distributed between eight trapezium-shaped trusses. Thus, a single trapezium truss was analyzed, and then extended to approximate the entire bridge. Internal forces, nodes and members are labelled as per Figure~\ref{trap}. As the truss is symmetrical, only two nodes needed to be analyzed.

		\end{figure}
		For a load of 100N divided equally between nodes A and B, force equilibrium for nodes A and C are described in equation blocks \ref{eqn1} and \ref{eqn2} respectively.
		% insret calculations here
		\begin{subequations}
			\begin{align}
				F_s \sin 56 = 50 N, \\
				F_s \cos 56 = F_t.
			\end{align} \label{eqn1}
		\end{subequations}
		\begin{subequations}
			\begin{align}
				F_s \sin 56= F_r, \\ 
				F_s \cos 56 = F_b.
			\end{align} \label{eqn2}
		\end{subequations}
		The results of solving the above equations are presented in Table~\ref{loads}.

				187 3x3 mm (bottom) & 33.7 N (t) \\ \hline
			\end{tabular}

		\end{table}
		% assumptions
		% fail predictions
		% max load
		Maximum loads for each member were calculated using the values given in the Assignment sheet. Modulus of elasticity $E=3\mathrm{GN}/\mathrm{m}^2$, standard deviation $\sigma=+2.4/-2.1\mathrm{MN}/\mathrm{m}^2$. Tensile strength $\sigma_t=20\mathrm{GN}/\mathrm{m}^2$,  standard deviation $\sigma=+3.6/-3.4\mathrm{MN}/\mathrm{m}^2$. Compressive strength $\sigma_t=12\mathrm{GN}/\mathrm{m}^2$,  standard deviation $\sigma=+2.1/-2.8\mathrm{MN}/\mathrm{m}^2$. To calculate maximum load from strength values, equation \ref{eqs} was used. The results are presented in Table~\ref{maxloads}.
		\begin{equation}
			\sigma=\frac{P}{A}
