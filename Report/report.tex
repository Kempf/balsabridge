	\section{Design}
		% design assumptions and methods
		\subsection{Assumptions}
		During the design process, the following assumptions have been made \citep[p.~264]{tbook}:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item All loadings are applied at the joint,
			\item Weight of the members neglected,
			\item Joints are smooth (friction-less) pins,
			\item Each member has no more than two joints.
		\end{enumerate}
		% TODO: why trapezium
		%Talk about other designs we have considered
		%Warren truss, Pratt etc
		%Include a photo of a prototype if that is avaliable? Maybe.. Alex?
		Final bridge design can be seen in Figures \ref{dim} and \ref{proj}.

		%Add dimensions of the 5mm and the 3mm layering ?

		% dimensioned drawing
		\subsection{Methods}
		%Construction process 
		%Materials Used
		%Difficulties faced - measuring accurately, It ended up being 185mm than 187mm and the trapezium was also slightly lopsided by a 1mm
		%Weight issues - glue 
		%Insert picture of the materials used
		%Paul do that cool photoshop thing that you did with the other picture. I will send you the picture soon
