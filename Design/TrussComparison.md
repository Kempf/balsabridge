#Truss type comparison
I don't want to invent a bycicle here, so here's a comparison between the three most common brige truss types. They must've became that popular for a reason.
###Warren:

###Howe:

###Pratt:

As you can see, Warren truss has no zero-force members, but has long diagonal members under compression (which is more dangerous than tension in our case).
With Pratt, the shorter vertical members are under tension instead, and Howe truss has less zero-force members. Which one should we use?

Please post any of your findings, test results etc.

UPD: Warren-truss bridge (made out of slightly thicker balsa) has won a battle against a frying pan. No real scientific tests were conducted.
